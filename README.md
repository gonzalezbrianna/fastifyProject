Creating demo Fastify projects written in JavaScript. 

The HelloWorld folder holds my first demo to simply preint to the local API endpoint

The Routes folder holds a more complex version of that prints Hello and Goodbye statements housed in routes, controllers, services, and datastores.

The Users folder holds a unique multidimensional, complex project that has layers that are seperate based by entities (eg. users). It has a full project interface that calls for CRUD.
